## About The Project
<p>The purpose of this application is to create a robust backend that can handle users registration and authentication using JWT. The events are for a typically calendar app where you can do CRUD operations but always keeping security of users. The app was developed using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB</p>

## Installation
First, you need to download the project and install or simply clone it.

Next, enter to the project dir using a Terminal, and enter the next command to rebuild the npm modules:
```
npm install
```

## Setting up the DB
To connect the database, you need to create a new database in MongoDB using your username and password. Then you need to create your own environment variables using dotenv and check the database is up and running

## Execute app in dev environment
Once the database is connected the only remaining step is to run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm run dev
```


### Notes:
You can work with this backend using a frontend with a framework like React or Angular, or you can use a service like Postman or Insomnia to simulate that functionality
